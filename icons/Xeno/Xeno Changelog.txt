XENO CHANGELOG

VERSION: 1.7c
-Redid a few sensor parts to accomodate the new nightvision button, a big eye that turns green when enabled.
  THE OXYGEN, FIRE, AND TOXINS ALIEN ALERTS MUST BE REPLACED FOR THIS TO LOOK RIGHT.

VERSION: 1.7b
-Minor fixes to crusher xeno
-Changes hunter stalk transparency from 25 to 75 so it's not almost completely invisible. It's still very hard to see on the corresponding resin color, especially when it's dark.
-Moved all 2x1 xenos to a new .dmi, both regular and accurate 2x1 xenos share it.
-Loads more inhands for facehuggers on every possible stance and size of alien.
  Some of these are WIP!

VERSION: 1.7a
-I can't even describe how much has been done and changed. A lot.

VERSION: 1.6.6
-Finally gets around to making the 2x2 praetorian fully detailed in all forms.
-Some fixes, maybe, I don't remember.

VERSION: 1.6.5d
-Fixes white pixel on north 1x1 praetorian hunt stance, how embarrasing!

VERSION: 1.6.5c
-Adds various new facehug sprites for dead ian/puppy, goat, cow, and space carp. 
-WIP larva inhands and resist animation.

VERSION: 1.6.5b
-Fixes for queen and praetorian sprites. Adds shadows to all of them and fixes up some minor details. Please apply these!

VERSION: 1.6.5
-Xeno Empress
-Swimmer Xeno
-Accurate versions and all corresponding necessary stuff.

VERSION: 1.6.4
-Pheremone pods
-Royal jelly
-New queen powers -- obey, help, and view.
-Queen hive view, much like the red circle when you get hurt, except this is for observing fellow xenos. Credits all go to whitheredGryphon.
-Queen pinpointer. All xenos that are not the queen can see where she is. Works like a pinpointer pointing at the nuke disk, except for the current living queen.
-Nest overlays for when you buckle people onto nests.
-Spitter, replaces the sentinel's sprites because the sentinel was too hard to distinguish half the time.
-Runner, a larva born from a dog, a goat, or a cow. Faster than all other xenos. Cannot hold onto items.

VERSION: 1.6.3

VERSION: 1.6.2

VERSION: 1.6.1

VERSION: 1.6b
-Dark and accurate versions of chittin, claws and weed extracts. Accurate versions of infected 1 and infected 3.
